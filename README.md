# transparency

## About

transparency is an ongoing project by [Aar√≥n Montoya-Moraga](http://montoyamoraga.io/)

transparency is an ever-evolving multimedia self-portrait. It currently includes text and images, with information about the author's identity, beliefs, health, employment, contact, among others.

transparency can be accessed at the website [montoyamoraga.io/transparency](http://montoyamoraga.io/transparency/) and the code and history of the project lives at the repository [github.com/montoyamoraga/transparency](https://github.com/montoyamoraga/transparency)
